# Transposition Cipher Virtual Lab

An interactive Virtual Cryptography Laboratory designed to study and observe permutation-based encryption and decryption in classical ciphers.

## Experiment Overview
The laboratory explores position-based permutations and their inverse restorations:
1. **Rail Fence Cipher (Keyless Transposition)**: Characters are written in a geometric zig-zag pattern across user-selectable rails (rows) with cycle period T = 2(r - 1), then read row by row.
2. **Columnar Transposition Cipher (Keyed Transposition)**: Characters are written into a rectangular grid row-by-row beneath a secret keyword and extracted vertically according to the alphabetical rank order of the keyword characters.

## Laboratory Features

### 1. Interactive Simulation Workbench
- **Dual Cipher Modes**: Toggle between Rail Fence and Columnar Transposition.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**:
  - Zig-zag rails with live character slot positioning and coordinate indicators.
  - Rectangular permutation matrix with keyword headers, alphabetical rank badges, and dummy character ('X') padding indicators.
- **Step-by-Step Playback Controller**:
  - Full playback controls: Play, Pause, Step Forward, Step Backward, Reset, and Speed Adjustment.
  - **Live Status Narrator**: Real-time explanation of every transformation step for both encryption and decryption.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Support for custom keywords and quick presets (ZEBRA, CRYPTO, SECRET, GERMAN, BALLOON).
  - One-click Encrypt, Decrypt, and Clear.
  - Clipboard copy.

### 2. Permutation Explorer
- **Cauchy Two-Line Notation**: Automatically renders the standard two-line mathematical permutation representation.
- **Disjoint Cycle Decomposition**: Decomposes the active permutation into cyclic groups.
- **Full Permutation Table**: Detailed mapping table displaying input index, character, transformation path, destination index, and ciphertext symbol.

### 3. Curriculum & Assessment Modules
- **Aim & Objectives**: Clear 2-point academic objectives covering both ciphers.
- **Comprehensive Theory**: Mathematical formulation of permutations, inverse permutations, period equations, and cryptanalytic vulnerabilities.
- **Benchmark Test Cases**: Pre-configured test vectors with instant Load & Simulate execution.
- **Self-Assessment Quiz**: Conceptual multiple-choice questions with grading and explanations.
- **Viva Voce**: Frequently asked university exam questions with collapsible model answers.

## Algorithm Conventions

1. **Input Sanitization**:
   - Punctuation, symbols, and spaces are removed; letters are normalized to uppercase.
2. **Rail Fence Zig-Zag**:
   - Alternates downwards from row 0 to row r-1, then upwards to row 0.
   - Oscillation cycle period: T = 2(r - 1).
3. **Columnar Key Ranking & Deduplication**:
   - Repeated letters in the secret keyword are removed to retain only the first occurrence (e.g. BALLOON → BALON).
   - Unique keyword letters are sorted alphabetically to determine column extraction order.
4. **Dummy Character Padding**:
   - When message length n is not a multiple of key length m, dummy characters ('X') are appended to fill the grid completely (ceil(n/m) × m cells).
   - Decryption reconstructs the grid from equal-height columns and strips the trailing dummy 'X' characters to recover the original plaintext.
